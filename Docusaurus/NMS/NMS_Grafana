## NMS Grafana Dashboards
Grafana is now replacing the metrics dashboards in the NMS. Grafana provides a much more powerful, configurable, 
and user-friendly dashboarding solution. Usage should be hassle-free with the new deployment.

What’s New?
In the metrics page of the nms, there is now a tab called ‘Grafana’

You’ll see three dashboards available to you from the start. These replicate the three dashboards in
the NMS that are built-in. Go to one of the dashboards, and you’ll now see a Grafana version of the NMS dashboard.
